## Technologies Used
* **HTML**: Used for structuring the game board and interface.
* **CSS**: For styling and animations, paired with Google fonts rendering a familiar notebook aesthetic.
* **JavaScript**: Drives the game's logic, handles user interactions, and updates the game state.

## Approach
1. **Wireframe**: The development began with a wireframe that served as a blueprint for the game design and interface.

2. **Development Plans**:
* ðŸ¥‰ **Bronze (MVP)**: A basic, fully functional Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other on the same computer.
* ðŸ¥ˆ **Silver**: Enhancements to the basic version, including tracking and displaying scores, animations, sound effects, improved user interface, and the introduction of a computer opponent (AI).  
_Current Progress_: All features implemented except for the AI opponent.
* ðŸ¥‡ **Gold**: Future enhancements such as online multiplayer, and data persistence.
3. **Modular Design**: The game logic and player details are encapsulated in separate classes (Game and User respectively).
4. **Object-Oriented Programming**: The game and players are represented as objects, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
5. **Event-Driven**: User interactions such as icon selection and grid clicks are handled through event listeners.

## Main Features
* **Icon Selection**: Before the game starts, the player can choose their icon, X or O.
* **Sound Effects**: Enhanced user experience with engaging sound effects. A distinct sound plays when drawing the board, and an audible signal when a player wins or when there's a tie.
* **Smooth Onboarding Animations**: Visual cues, in the form of subtle animations, guide the players. Whether it's an indication that the game has started or a gentle nudge that a spot is already taken.
* **Responsiveness**: Play on any device! The game is designed to adapt and look great whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

## Room for Improvement
* **AI Opponent**: Upgrade the computer opponent for a smarter model.
* **Online Multiplayer**: Allowing two players to play against each other online.
* **Persist Data**: Allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity.
